BotQueue
========

Control your 3D Printer over the Internet.  Out of the box support for slicing, webcams, queue-based job management, temperature logging, API, and much more.  BotQueue works great for controlling a single 3D printer or dozens of printers.  Control your bot from anywhere in the world, even using your cellphone!  Currently supports RepRap style machines, but will expand to others if there is interest.

The main BotQueue site is at www.botqueue.com

Philosophy and Goals
-------------

Digital fabrication / manufacturing is set to become one of the most important technologies of the 21st century.  Taking a cue from one of the most important technologies of the 20th century (the Internet) I believe that access to free and open tools is extremely important.  Allowing people of all skill levels access to these tools allows learning, innovation, and entrepreneurship to flower.  BotQueue aims to fulfill three goals:

1. Play Well With Others - interface with any digital fabrication device that will allow itself to be interfaced with.
1. Open and Free - all software behind BotQueue should be open source and freely available.  Both server and client side.
1. High Standards of Quality - lets build awesome software for everyone to do amazing things with!
