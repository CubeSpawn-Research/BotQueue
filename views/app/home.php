		<h2>Bumblebee - Official Client App</h2>
		<p>
			Bumblebee is the software that runs on your computer itself and turns it into a herder of bots.  This application will pull down jobs from BotQueue.com, and direct your 3D printer to create them.  To get nerdy, it is a cross-platform (w/m/l) python app designed to interface with BotQueue.  It is alpha software and currently only has a commandline interface.
		</p>
		<p>
			It is can control the following types of machines:
			<ul>
				<li>Most RepRap Machines (w/ <a href="https://github.com/grbl/grbl/">grbl</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kliment/Sprinter">Sprinter</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ErikZalm/Marlin/">marlin</a>, etc)</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<h3>Getting and Using Bumblebee</h3>
